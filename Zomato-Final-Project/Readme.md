# Overview
The purpose of this report is to find out what makes the restaurant popular and generates the highest income and provide some recommendations to keep these restaurants successful.

# Questions asked for this project:
• What restaurants are popular

• What kind of cuisine are popular (this will relate back to the restaurants and see if restaurants selling popular cuisines are more popular)

• Does rating counts equal a higher rating

• What restaurant generates the highest revenue

• Do restaurants that have more orders correlate to the restaurant having higher ratings

• Does the location of restaurant determine more popular reviews

# Findings
After conducting my research i have found that the best performing restaurant are dessert, fast-food and pizza in terms of revenue and the rating. Although most of the restaurants are western chain restaurants there are few that are local and highly rated.

Some of the recommendations for these restaurants to increase the rating and revenues is to provide a coupon for customers after making a review. Another ways is by making advertisement both physical and online to boost the number of sales and rating. Another recommendation is to provide premium customer service and make sure to keep customers data for future use. for example, sending the customers gift card on their special day. Another way is creating customer loyalty program for example if the customer order more than three times should get free drink or dessert.
