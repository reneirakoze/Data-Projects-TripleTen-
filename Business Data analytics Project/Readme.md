# Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze raw transactions log for E-commerce company.

# Data
• user_id: unique customer IDs • event_type: the type of activity by the user • category_code: category of the product being viewed or purchased • brand: company that makes the product • price: price of the product, in USD • event_date: date of the user activity, in YYYY-MM-DD format

# Results
According to my analysis there is continuous decrease in number of purchases comparing to their first month purchases.however there is a slight uptick in customers going from the shopping cart stage to the purchase stage. We will need to investigate ways to get customers to put items into their shopping cart after the viewing stage. As the months go by, customers are purchasing less. However, there is a small percentage of customers made their first purchase on 2020-09 and 2020-10 who return to make purchases during the fourth month. Efforts should be made to get customers coming back and purchase more products after their first purchase.
